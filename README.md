This is an e-commerce app which sells tennis lessons. It is written in Ruby on Rails and uses the Stripe API to securely process credit card payments. The tennis lessons are sold in packages ranging from a single-lesson package to a ten-lesson package. When a user visits the site they fill out the sign up form where they enter their email address and choose a password for their new account. The user is sent an email containing a link to validate their email address. When the user clicks the email validation link they are logged in and taken to their dashboard. 

The dashboard is where users can view their order history and see which lessons are available/used. The dashboard contains a button to purchase more lessons. Users purchase a lesson package via one-time credit card payments. The app processes the payment securely using the Stripe API. The credit card number, CVC number, and expiration date are validated by the Stripe API. Stripe generates a secure token using client-side JavaScript. The secure token is sent to the server as a hidden field. The post request is routed to the PurchasesController create action. In the create action the secure token is used to process the payment.

Tennis instructors can login and enter the date on which a lesson was given. They can also change the status of a lesson from "Available" to "Used"
